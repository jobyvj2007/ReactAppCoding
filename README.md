# ReactAppCoding
Please see my code with this link

I completed below tasks,

- **Questions List**: Turn question list into a grid layout.
### :sparkles: Improvements
- **Questions List**: Make *published_at* readable to humans.
- **Questions List**: Sort questions by published date, with new questions on the bottom.

I tried in my best. It is taking time to understand the code structure and I faced some issues while triggering API call for the existing services.

I have a few experience only in React.

I am very good in Object Oriented JS, Design patterns, Angular5 with NGRX Redux, ES6, CSS3, Grids, HTML5 etc.
